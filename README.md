# Carcassonne

This is a project from CMU 17214 Principle of Software Construction. First I designed the UML diagram of this game then I implement the main funcitons. After testing the main function with thousand lines of code, I built the GUI with Swing and use the observer pattern to decouple the GUI from the main function. 
The design documents are in the design_documents folder.
